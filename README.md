# SVG Logo Maker

## Description
The SVG Logo Maker is a command-line application that allows users to generate a simple logo in SVG format based on their inputs. Users can customize the text, text color, shape, and shape color, and the application will generate an SVG file (logo.svg) accordingly.

This project is built using Node.js, and it leverages the Inquirer package for handling user inputs and Jest for unit testing of the shape classes.

   "test": "jest"
}

## Usage
Run the Application:

To generate an SVG logo, run the following command:

The application will prompt you to:

Enter up to 3 characters for the text in your logo.
Select the text color (either by keyword or hexadecimal value).
Choose a shape (Circle, Square, or Triangle).
Specify the shape's color (either by keyword or hexadecimal value).

## Generated File:

After the prompts, the application will create an SVG file named logo.svg in the root directory. This file can be opened in any browser or SVG viewer to see the logo.

## Testing
Unit tests for the shape classes (Circle, Square, and Triangle) are included in the project. To run the tests, use the following command:
